# The-Book-of-Page-Numbers
This is a simple interactive model demonstrating how every possible 7×7 binary image (2⁴⁹ = 562,949,953,421,312 combinations) can be generated by counting in binary. Inspired by The Book of Page Numbers concept, the HTML file shows the emergence of infinite visual possibility from pure on/off logic.
