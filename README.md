# The-Book-of-Page-Numbers
This is a simple interactive model demonstrating how every possible 7×7 binary image (2⁴⁹ = 562,949,953,421,312 combinations) can be generated by counting in binary. 
Inspired by The Book of Page Numbers concept, the HTML file shows the emergence of infinite visual possibility from pure on/off logic.

How to Use the Interactive Binary Matrix Model
This model visualizes all 562,949,953,421,312 possible images in a 7×7 binary grid.

Press "Go" to begin the binary count.

The number grows outward in a spiral, updating in real time.

Use the slider to change the speed.

Click any square in the matrix or bottom row to toggle it between black (1) and white (0).

Every combination of on/off dots represents a unique frame—together, they contain all possible images.
